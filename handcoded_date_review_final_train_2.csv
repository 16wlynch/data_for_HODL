    Peacock is great for Olympics but not much else
  
","









  
  
    
  We bought the plus WITH commercials thinking it would be like normal broadcast TV commercials but it is not 150 seconds per break with last 60 seconds interrupting sporting events.  Totally not desirable and it's the same commercials each time, you begin to actually hate the products.  When nbc mess's up you see a black screen saying will be back shortly when there should have been a commercial.  Do not order peacock with commercials instead order peacock plus ad free.  It's the only version doable.  It is not totally ad free you get some 30 second commercials at random times even during the action.  Probably the control room not paying attention.  It really does feel like amateur hour with replays being right above highlights of the same event so it's possible to see in the headlines who won before you watch it.  But on a positive note the replays are fantastic much better than cobbled together nbc primetime where it's you get what they think you want.  Also the replays tend to have far less drama and no politics.  Amazon allowed us to change our subscription to ad free which is the way to go.  We will be cancelling subscription after Olympics, we could not find anything else to watch.  Very limited content.

  We have had Peacock for 4 months bc Amazon Prime decided to take off 2 of my favorite shows. Why Amazon Prime? But, every time we select the show or to go to the app itself, it would literally take almost an entire minute to load. And then it wouldn't load the specific show but would go to the list of shows & seasons. Then after every show you would wait & wait until it would take you all the way back to the seasons list again. It's supposed to go right to the next show after one plays. Nope, unless you're lucky one day. Every other channel I have on Prime starts & works perfectly fine, so it's not my internet.  Canceled today bc I'm not paying $10.99 for a channel I can't even watch!

  Downloaded this app to watch 2020(1) Olympics.  All the advertising on NBC indicated that additional events would be broadcast on Peacock.  Events on Peacock were not live, but delayed by more than a day in most cases for events I wanted to see live.  Actually, live shows mostly required authorization with some other outrageously priced 3rd party service subscription.  This app is worse than useless.

    Absolutely ruined the super bowl
  
","









  
  
    
  This apps inability to remember a save point during a live event like the super bowl caused me to miss the entirety of the 4th quarter. If your streaming service cannot retain replay rights for an event that grandiose for up to one hour after event end, perhaps you should get out of the steaming service. Some ppl need to pause these thing, and to have play back abilities removed is a horrifying realization after shaking a screen awake after a minute of sleep.I will never use peacock again. other than being a cable giant that has contracts for major events,they being nothing to the table

  Using on Fire TV and excited to view programming.  However, stream consistently laggs and/ or buffers.  I understand this could also by an issue with my Fire TV, however I experience similar issues on my cable system box on our regular TV.

    Buggy App
  
","









  
  
    
  The app has a lot of lag. You can open it and it takes nearly 30 seconds to load. It's not a network issue, because other apps are fast to load. It also has a bug related to going to the screensaver. If you walk away after pausing the app, and it goes to the screensaver, the whole stick has to be unplugged and started again, as the remote is unresponsive. Again, it's only in this app that the fire stick becomes unresponsive. We also get occasional (maybe 3-4 times a week) warnings our bluetooth remote needs to be paired when using Peacock. But never have gotten that message in Netflix, Hulu, Prime, etc. So it's again a bug in the Peacock app. I've reported that, and been told it's not big bugs, so Peacock isn't interested in bug reports. It works, it's just a pain to have to work around their obvious bugs.

  UPDATED: 10-08-2021:  They EARN 5 STARS for FREE and we'll see for what I am paying for. We have ""Peacocked"" for about a year, free. Now, I'll be buying the ANNUAL $49.99 streaming service, instead of the $4.99 per month subscription.I have to agree that the free version does seem to pay with the volume settings, randomly;  Hopefully the Premium doesn't, else I'll likely not renew. I don't mind watching commercials:  I'm a computer-savvy sixty-PLUS individual, so I won't go to the ""Commecial Free"" / ""Downloadable"" Super-Version.For some reason, the FireStick-Peacock app (free) doesn't often disconnect (IMPROVED!), like Paramount app (paid) does, but both will send you to your TV set / Amazon Device HOMESCREEN and might actually turn off your device.We find it odd that some ""Law & Order"" and ""CSI"" series are to be found on each, but... Great!Since Peacock is NBC and Paramount is carrying CBS We get some of the best entertainment, commercials and all. That might allow us to delete a good CABLE-CUTTERS option (Philo $20 per month Subscription).

  This app works great on an iPad but not so much with the Firestick.  The picture freezes and sometimes shut down while using the app.  I've had to clear the cache and delete the app before re-installing.  Not to mention there's a lot of buffering.  If I wasn't in the middle of a binge I would cancel the subscription and move along.  Once done I plan to do just that.  I would rather use the app with the Firestick and not the iPad.

  Was forced to switch to Peacock when they absorbed the WWE Network.  Yes, my monthly bill went down, but so did the overall quality of the service.  Yes I had more content, but I could search for a 'featured' program (it was literally one of the slides on their front page) and it wouldn't show it as existing.  They don't have a live pause button, that's a common feature of many streaming services and your local cable provider.  The quality (picture/sound) has gone downhill drastically.  The feed often becomes grainy during live events.  Yes, I know that there are MANY things that could contribute to this but it seems to happen every event I watch since Peacock took over as the platform.  The overall user interface feels like a grad student in web design made it for a school project.  I've considered buying a VPN just to use the WWE Network in England.  The extra cost might be worth the alleviation of the suffering Peacock causes me every time I try and use it.
