  I discovered this on one of those late night TV show ads on TV. I thought I would try it because I love old school threes of company and love boat. They have all sorts of awesome shows, my one complaint is since it's so new you get a lot of the same commercials over and over or long pauses work commercials won't be. I love that it's free, and they have long spaces before they repeat. They also have current shows, they have a good selection because I think their parent company is Viacom. Definitely worth downloading

I canceled my subscription and got a full refund for. The month I paid for. So, excellent customer service. I loved what they had to offer, and will keep checking reviews to see if this problem gets rectified because I really want this app to work.  BTW, I use the firestick. Maybe if you use something else it will work for u. I also tried to mirror to from the app on my cell to my TV but it was just a black screen.

  I signed up for one program. When I read that there is a maximum number of hours for watching free. After that $39.95.  One must be careful not to reach the limit, or they stick it to you. Luckily, I found the program I liked on another service, which is FREE!I also resent the advertising push to watch more and more programs! - When are going to work? Even if you are retired, you have more useful activities than to watch video, that does not enhance anything in your life. Imagine what would happen, if everybody were to watch ""stupid' videos, and do nothing else.

  Very disappointed to find that after watching one episode of a series, I would have to upgrade to Peacock Premium to watch the rest.

  I downloaded and created a name emoji and went to watch something and screen was totally black.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled and same thing keeps happening.  I signed up for the $4.99 month subscription and have yet to be able to watch anything.  I cant seem to locate a place to find help with situation.

  The continent on here is vast. The streaming quality is excellent I am using a wireless router in a large oversized home and I am very far from my router and I am just blown away by the quality of the stream on this channel. I am comparing this primarily to Paramount plus which I have had since they started the Netwerk when it was called the CBS app and in comparison this is way better than Paramount plus. There is a vast amount of new and vintage content. We are really enjoying some of the vintage shows on this app the quality is better than other channels that have offered these programs.  I give the peacock channel very high marks
